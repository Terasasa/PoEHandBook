# Using the databases
The item databases are mostly parsed directly from [PoE wiki](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Path_of_Exile_Wiki).
All credit (as well as blame) for the information goes to the authors of respective materials.
If you plan on using the .xml files for your own projects, please credit the Wiki for the provided information and me for parsing it into a schema format.
